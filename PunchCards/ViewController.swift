     Punch-Out
     - each punch card will have an image, a name, a goal, and a count
     
     As a user I want an app that will be a digital punch cards for businesses that store and tracks rewards.
     - collectionview with each punchcard's image, title, and current punches displayed
        - tap on one to see detailed information/tableview with each punch's date and description
     
     The app will have an admin and user feature.
     
     
     Punches will be made secure via a password set by admin.
     
     
     The punch cards will be 100% customizable based on the business needs.
